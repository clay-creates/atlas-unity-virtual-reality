## Project Overview

Atlas Unity Virtual Reality started as a collection of VR learning exercises and evolved into a fully featured VR repository. Each sub-project focuses on unique aspects of VR interaction, accessibility, and user experience, including a 360-video player, VR accessibility testing, and avatar motion capture. By integrating gaze-based controls, hand pose recognition, and interactive physics environments, these projects serve as a foundational toolkit for building immersive VR applications.

## Projects

### `360-video`
A VR application for playing 360-degree videos in an immersive environment. Users can watch and control panoramic video content, making it suitable for cinematic or educational VR experiences.

### `accessibility`
This project is dedicated to exploring accessibility in VR, including testing and implementing gaze controls, adjustable UI elements, and other accessibility options to make VR experiences more inclusive for all users.

### `avatar-motion`
A VR workspace featuring a player avatar connected to the XR origin, allowing user movements to be mirrored by the avatar. This scene includes an under-development motion recording system to capture player movements as animations that can be applied to other models.

### `intro-to-vr`
A VR sandbox for foundational VR interactions such as grabbing, releasing, throwing, and climbing. It serves as a learning environment for experimenting with essential VR control mechanisms.

### `physics-interaction`
A VR sandbox focused on physics-based interactions. This scene includes stackable blocks, a sword with multipoint grabbing, a lever, and other physics-based interactables, allowing users to explore dynamic object manipulation in VR.

### `pose-emote`
An experimental VR environment under development for recognizing hand poses and using controller positions to trigger emotes. The system is designed to provide immersive character expressions and gestures based on user input.

## Future Development

- **Enhanced Avatar Customization**: Expanding avatar capabilities for more realistic user representation.
- **Expanded Accessibility Options**: Adding more accessibility features such as voice control and customizable contrast settings.
- **Physics Optimization**: Improving physics interactions for smoother and more reliable object manipulation.
- **Multi-User Support**: Enabling shared VR experiences and collaborative interactions in virtual environments.

## Requirements

- **Unity**: Version 2020.3 or later
- **XR Plugin Management**: Ensure appropriate XR plugins are installed for your headset (Oculus, SteamVR, etc.)
- **Scripting Runtime**: .NET 4.x Equivalent
